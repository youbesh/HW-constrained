    "# A Portfolio Choice Problem\n",

    "* Assume we have $n$ assets, and asset number 1 is the safe asset. It will pay 1 for sure next period.\n",
    "* Assets $i=2,\\dots,n$ are risky and pay $z_i^s$ in state $s=1,\\dots,S$\n",
    "* State $s$ occurs with probability $\\pi^s$\n",
    "* The investor is characterized by\n",
    "    * an initial endowment of each asset: $(e_1,e_2,\\dots,e_n)$\n",
    "    * a utility function $u(c) = -\\exp(-ac)$\n",

    "### Questions\n",

    "* Assume $n=3,p=(1,1,1),e=(2,0,0)$ and suppose that $z_2 = (0.72,0.92,1.12,1.32),z_3=(0.86,0.96,1.06,1.16)$. Each of these realizations is equally likely to occur, and all assets are independent. This means we have a total of $4\\times4=16$ random states.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve this problem using `NLopt`. \n",
    "    * Define 2 functions `obj` and `constraint`, similar to the way we set this up in class.\n",
    "    * In particular, remember that both need to modify their gradient `in-place`. \n",
    "2. Solve the problem using `JuMP`.\n",
    "    * Stick to the example given in the slides.\n",
    "3. For both approaches, compute 3 different solutions for parameter $a\\in\\{0.5,1,1.5\\}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution in both cases is correct if it produces the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| a   | c       | omega1    | omega2    | omega3   | fval      |\n",
    "|-----|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|\n",
    "| 0.5 | 1.00801 | -1.41237  | 0.801458  | 1.60291  | -1.20821  |\n",
    "| 1.0 | 1.00401 | -0.206197 | 0.400729  | 0.801462 | -0.732819 |\n",
    "| 5.0 | 1.0008  | 0.758762  | 0.0801456 | 0.160291 | -0.013422 |\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your tests should contain this table as a `DataFrame` called `truth`.\n",
    "* You should provide functions `table_JuMP()` and `table_NLopt()`, each of which produces this table.\n",
    "* The test is then to compare each column of your function output to `truth`\n",
